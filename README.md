# Demo: Real-Time Data Streaming with PubNub

## WORK IN PROGRESS

**PubNub makes it easy to connect and consume massive real time streaming data and deliver usable information to any number of subscribers.** These "firehoses of data" could be weather reports, business metrics, stock quotes, tweets - really any source of data that is constantly changing and emitting updates. PubNub’s Data Stream Network handles keeping both publishers and subscribers securely connected and ensuring that every piece of data is generally available in real time, so scale (or the amount of data you’re sending) is never an issue.

We’ve built sample realtime data streams to make it easy for you to prototype your streaming application.  It is those sample data streams that are consumed by this demo app.

## Demo

A hosted demo version of this application can be seen at XXX

## Features

## Installing / Getting Started

To run this project yourself just launch the `index.html` page.  You do not need your own Publish and Subscribe keys because you are only subscribing to existing data streams.
